# Swift Array Index Out of Range Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: the "index out of range" error. This happens when you try to access an element in an array using an index that is outside the bounds of the array. 

The `bug.swift` file shows the error. `bugSolution.swift` demonstrates how to prevent this using bounds checking.
